    <h1><em>The animals:</em></h1>
    <p>Animals are <strong>multicellular, eukaryotic organisms</strong> in the biological kingdom Animalia. With few exceptions, animals <strong>consume organic 
        material, breathe oxygen, are able to move, can reproduce sexually, and go through an ontogenetic stage</strong> in which their body consists 
        of a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula, during embryonic development. <em>Over 1.5 million living animal species</em> have been 
        described—of which around 1 million are insects—but it has been estimated there are over 7 million animal species in total. Animals
        range in length from 8.5 micrometres (0.00033 in) to 33.6 metres (110 ft). They have complex interactions with each other and their 
        environments, forming intricate food webs. The scientific study of animals is known as zoology.</p>
